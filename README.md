<h2>About</h2>
    <p>In this repository, I document my exploration and experimentation with data science and machine learning. From introductory concepts to advanced topics, this is my learning playground where I've stored my personal projects, code, and various resources. Whether you're new to the field or looking for inspiration, I hope you find something valuable here.</p>
 <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>I've undertaken a variety of data science and machine learning projects, covering a wide range of topics. Some of the projects you can find in this repository include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/yalgar0/Data-Scienc-and-ML-dice-camp-/blob/master/simple-linear-regression-for-beginners.ipynb">Project 1: Simple Linear Regression for Beginners</a>: An exploration into predictive modeling, where I built a model to forecast future sales based on historical data.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/yalgar0/Data-Scienc-and-ML-dice-camp-/tree/master/Price%20Prediction%20project%20-regression/project">Project 2: Project related to price prediction using Polynomial Regression.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each project comes with its own dedicated directory, containing code, data, and documentation to help you understand and replicate the work.</p>
<h2>Learning Journey</h2>
    <p>I believe in sharing knowledge and learning from others. Throughout my journey, I've documented my learning process, including tutorials, articles, and notes. You can find these in the <a href="/learning-journey">Learning Journey</a> directory. I encourage you to explore and engage with the resources I've collected.</p>
 <h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>If you have feedback, or suggestions, or are interested in collaborating on a project, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always open to learning from others and growing in the field of data science and machine learning.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my Data Science and Machine Learning repository, and I hope you find the content here both informative and inspiring. Happy learning and exploring!</p>
